# If you Forked it, Support it
A growing number of viewers are looking for high quality, professional content on Dash, which is hard to find. I am trying to fill that gap and help you grow in the area of analytic web apps in Python.

## Installation
I recommend installing pandas, since you will most likely use it.

    $ pip install pandas
    
Then, just install Dash. Plotly comes with Dash

    $ pip install dash
    
If you'd like to control the version of Plotly installed, you can do for example:

    $ pip install plotly==5.7.0
    
## To Get Help
